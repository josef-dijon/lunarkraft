# Lunarkraft

Lunarkraft modpack for Minecraft using Prism Launcher.

## LunarKraft Prism Launcher Guide

Prism Launcher is yet another Minecraft launcher, similar to the Curseforge launcher. Prism allows more flexibility in managing Minecraft instances, and managing keeping the client mod list up to date with the server. In the background, prism runs a [simple java program](https://github.com/josef-dijon/minecraft-mod-updater) to check that your mods are up to date each time you launch the Lunarkraft instance of minecraft.

Instances are completely separate from any version of Minecraft you already have installed, so the LunarKraft mods wont interfer with any other mod packs or servers you play on.

I've been using Prism Launcher for LunarKraft for several months now, and it is reliable, and far less bloatware-y than CurseForge/Overwolf.

## Setting up the Launcher

1. Download and install the Prism Launcher: https://prismlauncher.org/download/
2. Download the minecraft profile from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1up16fpZXkcrCy7KRcMKs4q9AklR1xqms/view?usp=drive_link
3. Once the launcher is installed, run it and click "Add Instance"

4. Select the "Import from zip" option, browse to the zip file and then click OK.

6. You'll be prompted to sign in if you haven't already. Click yes, and then "Add Microsoft". You'll be redirected to a Microsoft login page, just follow the prompts.

7. And that's it! Prism Launcher will download Minecraft, install the Fabric loader, and download all the mods, resource packs and shaders for the server. Once you're in, the LunarKraft server link will already be set up in the multiplayer screen on Minecraft. Note, the download takes a little bit, so be patient. And watch the log for any red text.
